	<h1>What is Data Mining?</h1>

	<p>Data Mining is a shorthand phrase for a part of what is known as the Knowledge Discovery Process.<br>
	It involes using mathematical algorithms to find useful patterns in extremely large datasets that are typically <br> collected by Internet of Things (IOT) devices. The patterns that are found are then interpreted by people to gain useful information. </p>

	<h1>Why is it Useful?</h1>

	<p>Data Mining is useful because it is able to harness computing power and statistical <br>methods simeltaneously to quickly find patterns that would take human investigators long periods of time to do by <br>hand. This is particularly useful in the field of medicine because of <br> personal genomics revolution and the large datasets that have accompanied it.</p>

	<hr>

	<h1>How is it Accomplished?</h1>

	<p>Data mining is accomplished using several different algorithmic methods discussed elsewhere on this <br>site. Major examples include Classification, Regression, Clustering and Association Rule Mining.</p>
