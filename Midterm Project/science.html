		<h3>Entanglement</h3>

			<p>Quantum Particles, such as electrons and photons have the abilty to <br>synchronize their actions and transport information across long <br>distances instantaneously. Our QPC leverages this property to speed up <br>the computation of everyday proccesses to levels that were <br>previously though to be unattainable.</p>

		<h3>Decoherence</h3>

			<p>Is the problem of isolating a Quantum State so it is not affected by <br>its environment. We have solved this problem by containing our <br>processer within an electromagnetic field that negates vibrations from <br>the outside world.</p>

		<h3>Multiple State Computations</h3>

			<p>We take adavantage of the fact that Quantum Computing can complete <br>multiple tasks simeltaneously to help you solve business and <br>personal problems. Giving your computer the ability to multitask as you <br>do.</p>
